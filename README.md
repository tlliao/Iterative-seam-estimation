# Quality evaluation-based iterative seam estimation for image stitching

1. Add images in the folder "Imgs" in the main path and run the "main.m".

2. This software has been tested on 64bit Windows; for other platforms, you'll
need to compile your own mex files for "graphCutMex".

3. Please cite the following if you use this software in any publications:
