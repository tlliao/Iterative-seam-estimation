# Quality evaluation-based iterative seam estimation for image stitching

1. MAXFLOW library (version 3.03) is required before running this code.

2. Add images in the folder "Imgs" and run the "main.m".

3. This software has been tested on 64bit Windows; for other platforms, you'll
need to compile your own mex files for "graphCutMex".

4. Please cite the following if you use this software in any publications:
